This program cannot read .wav file directly.
Extract wave data from .wav file with "dumpwave" first.
(The source code of "dumpwave.c" can be obtained at "https://oku.edu.mie-u.ac.jp/~okumura/dumpwave.c".)
"clwav.txt" is the extracted wave data from "cl.wav" with "dumpwave".

How to build:
Change directory to "Release" and execute "make".
